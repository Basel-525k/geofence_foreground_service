A Flutter plugin that enables you to easily handle geofencing events in your Flutter app by creating
a foreground service while being battery efficient since it uses
the [Geofence](https://developer.android.com/training/location/geofencing)
and [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) APIs.

It's important to note that the [workmanager](https://pub.dev/packages/workmanager)
and [flutter_foreground_task](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_foreground_task) plugins were a
great source of inspiration while creating this plugin.

## Features

- **Supports geofencing in foreground as well as background** üí™: The plugin utilizes the Foreground
  service API to stay running even after killing the app, ensuring all time geofence tracking.
- **Geofence a circular area** üó∫Ô∏è: You can add an ordinary geofence which is a point surrounded by a
  given radius.
- **Geofence a polygon** ü§Ø: You can add a geofence using a list of coordinates, the system will
  calculate the center of them and register it, having full polygon support is a WIP üöß
- **Notification customization** üîî: Displaying a notification when running a foreground service is
  mandatory, you can customize what is being displayed on it (title, content or the icon), the
  plugin displays the app icon by default.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
geofence_foreground_service: ^<latest>
```

## Setup

### üîß Android Setup

- Enable MultiDex, you can check how to do
  so [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#enabling-multidex-support)
- Add the service to the AndroidManifest.xml inside the application tag

```xml
<service android:name="com.f2fk.geofence_foreground_service.GeofenceForegroundService" />
```

## Example

Define the method that will handle the Geofence triggers

```dart
import 'package:geofence_foreground_service/exports.dart';
import 'package:geofence_foreground_service/geofence_foreground_service.dart';
import 'package:geofence_foreground_service/models/zone.dart';

// This method is a top level method
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
void callbackDispatcher() async {
  GeofenceForegroundService().handleTrigger(
    backgroundTriggerHandler: (zoneID, triggerType) {
      log(zoneID, name: 'zoneID');

      if (triggerType == GeofenceEventType.enter) {
        log('enter', name: 'triggerType');
      } else if (triggerType == GeofenceEventType.exit) {
        log('exit', name: 'triggerType');
      } else if (triggerType == GeofenceEventType.dwell) {
        log('dwell', name: 'triggerType');
      } else {
        log('unknown', name: 'triggerType');
      }

      return Future.value(true);
    },
  );
}
```

Then create an instance of the plugin to initiate it and assign GeoFences to it

```dart
final List<LatLng> timesSquarePolygon = [
  const LatLng(40.758078, -73.985640),
  const LatLng(40.757983, -73.985417),
  const LatLng(40.757881, -73.985493),
  const LatLng(40.757956, -73.985688),
];

Future<void> initPlatformState() async {
  // Remember to handle permissions before initiating the plugin

  bool hasServiceStarted = await GeofenceForegroundService().startGeofencingService(
    contentTitle: 'Test app is running in the background',
    contentText: 'Test app will be running to ensure seamless integration with ops team',
    notificationChannelId: 'com.app.geofencing_notifications_channel',
    serviceId: 525600,
    callbackDispatcher: callbackDispatcher,
  );

  if (hasServiceStarted) {
    await GeofenceForegroundService().addGeofenceZone(
      zone: Zone(
        id: 'zone#1_id',
        radius: 10000,
        coordinates: timesSquarePolygon,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

> Something important to point out is the callbackDispatcher method will run in an entirely
> different isolate than the actual app, so if you were to handle UI related code inside of it
> you'll
> need to use Ports, you can find more
> information
> [here](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_workmanager/issues/151#issuecomment-612637579)

You can pass a custom icon to the foreground service notification if you wish while initializing the
service, this icon will be placed inside the android/app/src/main/res folder, you can check the
example for more information, by default, it will take the app icon

```dart
const NotificationIconData(
  resType: ResourceType.mipmap,
  resPrefix: ResourcePrefix.ic,
  name: 'launcher',
)
```

## Notes

Handling permissions is not a part of the package, so please refer
to [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) plugin to grant the required
permissions (it's used in the example too)

- location
- locationAlways
- notification
